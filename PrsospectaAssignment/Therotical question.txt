Security and Reliability Considerations
Security:

1) I Will ensure that user inputs are validated before processing, especially in the POST request, to prevent injection attacks.

2) I Will implement proper authentication to secure API endpoints.

3) I Will set rate limits to prevent abuse of the API.

4)  I Will use HTTPS to secure the communication between the client and server.



Reliability:

1) I Will configure the HTTP client with timeouts and retries to handle network failures.

2) I Will ensure proper error handling and return meaningful error messages.
